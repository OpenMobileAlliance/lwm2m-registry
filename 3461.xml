				<Description><![CDATA[Specifies the capabilities supported by the device to manage and store remote sensors information retrieved from the sensor group as a Bit Mask:
Bit 0: Dynamic mapping support - Remote sensors can be discovered as new messages are received. If explicit mapping is required, new corresponding object instances will be automatically created
Bit 1: Implicit mapping support - Sensor state is maintained on an implementation specific internal database instead of being reflected into local objects
Bit 2: Auto clear support – Automatic clear to the default value is supported after validity time is expired]]></Description>
