                <Description>One or more CoRE Links to Resource instances from which the values will be stored in the Compact Data array. Each link results in a new item in the Compact Data array: first link points to the resource instance with the value for the first array item, second link to the instance with the second array item, etc. For single-instance resources the Resource instance ID can be omitted from the link, but for multi-instance Resources it MUST be present.</Description>
