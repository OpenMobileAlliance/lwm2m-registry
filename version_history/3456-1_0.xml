				<Description>This resource defines an operation to be performed between the value of the Control Program output and the value currently store in the LwM2M resource pointed by 'Target'. Possible operations: 1 - set 2 - min 3 - max 4 - add 5 - subtract 6 - multiply When operation or filter is not defined the default output operation is set</Description>

				<Description>When defined the control output is not immediately applied and transaction time = delay is implemented between the current target resource value and the value of the control program output.  This can be also associated to Fade Time in smart lighting scenario</Description>

				<Description>Limit the time period for which the output command should be considered valid. This is to be used in scenarios where Control Programs are not under continuous re-evaluation and for which the output control action is not continuously re-calculated. In such scenarios, the expiration time resource can be used to limit the time frame that the control output should be applied to the target resource.</Description>
