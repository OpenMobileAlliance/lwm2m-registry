1. Create an **[Issue](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry)** before submitting your ```Objects``` or ```Reusable Resources``` for Registration.

2. OMNA staff will validate the submission. If it failed, the submitter will be notified.
   
   > Note: Submissions of ```PRs``` that are not linked to an open Issue will be rejected.
   
3. If the Issue is accepted the OMNA staff will create a new branch, in this repository, where the user can submit new ```Object(s)``` | ```Reusable Resource(s)```.
   
   > Note: The staff will send a notification indicating that the new topic branch is ready.
   
4. To create successful ```Object(s)``` | ```Reusable Resource(s)``` use the provided **[LwM2M Editor](http://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/Legal?back=default.aspx)** and follow the **[Guidelines](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/wiki/Guidelines)** & **[Best Practice](https://wiki.openmobilealliance.org/display/TOOL/LwM2M+Best+Practice)**.   
   
5. Submit your ```Pull Request(s),(PRs)```, containing your ```Object(s)``` | ```Reusable Resource(s)``` registrations against the allocated branch.
    > Note: The OMA staff will [close]() any ```PR(s)``` submitted against the incorrect branch. 
  
6. Participate in the feedback provided by the Technical Working Group. The Group will provide comments to help you to improve your registration.
