				<Description><![CDATA[Integer representing the priority of the program within all program object instances.
Lower number (with sign) correspond to higher priorities.
Higher priority programs have pre-eminence over lower priority program schedule to be running in parallel in same day.
For example: Program #11 is scheduled to run every day between Jan 1st and Dec 31st with a priority 7
Program #22 is scheduled to run every Saturday between March 1st and June 30th with priority 3
Program #22 should apply for all Saturdays between March 1st and June 30th
Program #11 for all other Saturdays in the year
If compound operation is supported, functions are executed in a order based on this priority field]]></Description>

				<Description><![CDATA[The control Program is expected to be evaluated within a list of multiple control programs, where the evaluation occurs in an orderly fashion following the value set under its Priority resource. The compound operation resource, if set, will allow the output of the current control program acting on a given output#1 to be compounded with and output of a lower priority program acting on the same output #1. For example: 1) CP#1 priority 100, outputs 50% dimming level for light #1 with operation SET (compound flag is enabled) 2) CP#11 priority 500, outputs 10% dimming level for light #1 with operation ADD 3) Final light level on light#1 after CP list is executed is 60%]]></Description>
